# v0.6.0 beta 2

- Remove `Clock` and `Clocks` from the public API
- Sounds and effects now have an `on_clock_tick` callback instead of having a
  `&Clocks` argument passed into `process`
- Remove parameters
- Settings that were previously `Value`s can now be tweened directly without
  needing to link them to a parameter
- All functions that send commands to the renderer now use `CommandError` as
  their error type
- Effects now have a similar structure to sounds
  - `EffectBuilder` - trait for types that can be converted to an `Effect` and a
    handle
  - `Effect` - runs on the renderer
- `TrackSettings` is now `TrackBuilder`. Effects can be added by passing an
  `EffectBuilder` to `TrackBuilder::add_effect`.
- Changes to the built-in effects:
  - Removed `Distortion` from the public API, `DistortionSettings` is now
    `DistortionBuilder`, added `DistortionHandle`
  - Removed `Delay` from the public API, `DelaySettings` is now `DelayBuilder`,
    added `DelayHandle`
  - Removed `Reverb` from the public API, `ReverbSettings` is now
    `ReverbBuilder`, added `ReverbHandle`
  - Removed `Filter` from the public API, `FilterSettings` is now
    `FilterBuilder`, added `FilterHandle`
- Renamed `Tweenable` to `Tweener`
- Added a `Tweenable` trait for things that a `Tweener` can control. `Tweener`
  is now generic over the type of the `Tweenable` value
- Volume settings now use the `Volume` type instead of `f64`
- Playback rate settings now use the `PlaybackRate` type instead of `f64`
- Clock speed settings now use the `ClockSpeed` type instead of `f64`
- Fix audio artifacts when a static sound loops
- Slight performance improvement when sounds are center-panned

# v0.6.0 beta 1 - December 24, 2021

- Fix looping static sounds with a loop start position greater than 0.0 starting
  playback at that position. (The intended behavior is that the sound will still
  start at the beginning, but jump back to the loop start position after
  reaching the end.)

# v0.6.0 beta 0 - December 4, 2021

Complete rewrite, most things have changed

# v0.5.3 - May 31, 2021

- Fix an issue where the `AudioManager` cleanup would fail if there are existing
  track handles

# v0.5.2 - April 27, 2021

- Added `Sound::from_mp3_reader`, `Sound::from_ogg_reader`,
  `Sound::from_flac_reader`, and `Sound::from_wav_reader` (thanks @Zicklag!)
- (Hopefully) fixed an issue where capacities (the maximum number of instances,
  sequences, etc.) could decrease over time

# v0.5.1 - March 28, 2021

- Added a `Default` implementation for `TrackSends`
- Fixed a compile error when building Kira with the `serde_support` feature
  enabled

# v0.5.0 - March 7, 2021

## Additions

- Added send tracks, which you can route sub-tracks to in addition to their
  parent track. This is useful for sharing effects between multiple sub-tracks.
- Made the `volume` setting for `Track`s a `Value<f64>`, which means you can
  link it to a parameter
- Added `Main`/`Sub`/`SendTrackHandle::set_volume`
- Added an `init` callback to the `Effect` trait
- Added new effects: `Distortion`, `Delay`, and `Reverb`
- Added a `mix` setting for effects, which lets you blend dry and wet signal
- Added `InstanceHandle::position`, which gets the current playback position of
  the instance
- Added `CachedValue::with_valid_range` for clamping values

## Bugfixes

- The default filter cutoff is no longer outside of the range of human hearing

## Other changes

- Changed settings structs with an `id` field to use `Option<Id>`. This
  eliminates a confusing situation where cloning the same settings struct and
  passing it to multiple objects results in each object overwriting the previous
  one since it has the same ID.
- Changes to errors related to sending commands to the audio thread:
  - Command-sending related errors are now listed in the `CommandError` enum
  - `BackendDisconnected` is no longer included in error enums
  - Handle structs whose only error variant was `BackendDisconnected` now return
    a `CommandError`
  - `TrackHandleError` was split into `AddEffectError` and `RemoveEffectError`
- `MetronomeHandle.event_iter` has been replaced with
  `MetronomeHandle.pop_event`, which works the same way as
  `SequenceInstanceHandle.pop_event`
- Changed all occurrences of the term "pitch" to "playback rate"

# v0.4.1 - January 23, 2021

Added serde support for `Arrangement`s and `SoundClip`s

# v0.4.0 - January 23, 2021

## `wasm32` support

Kira now runs on any platform supporting `wasm32` and having a `cpal` backend.
This means one can now run an instance of Kira in a web browser.

## Handle-based API

The API has gone through a major revision. Previously, to do just about
anything, you would have to use the `AudioManager`:

```rust
audio_manager.stop_instance(instance_id)?;
audio_manager.set_metronome_tempo(Tempo(128.0))?;
// etc...
```

This meant that you had to pass a reference to the audio manager to every part
of the code that needs it. It also meant that the `AudioManager` struct had an
overwhelming number of methods.

The API has been changed so that whenever you create a new thing (like a sound,
an instance, or a mixer track), you receive a handle to that thing that you can
use to control it.

```rust
let mut sound = audio_manager.load_sound("sound.ogg", SoundSettings::default())?;
let mut instance = sound.play(InstanceSettings::default())?;
instance.set_pitch(2.0)?;
```

## Multiple metronomes

You can now create multiple metronomes. Each sequence instance can be assigned
to a different metronome, and interval events can be received from a
`MetronomeHandle`:

```rust
let mut metronome = audio_manager.add_metronome(
	MetronomeSettings::new().interval_events_to_emit([0.25, 0.5, 1.0]))?;
audio_manager.start_sequence({
	let mut sequence = Sequence::<()>::new(SequenceSettings::default());
	// sequence code
	sequence
}, SequenceInstanceSettings::new().metronome(&metronome))?;
metronome.start()?;
for interval in metronome.event_iter() {
	println!("{}", interval);
}
```

Most people will only need one metronome at a time - the main point of this is
to move more functionality out of the `AudioManager` struct.

## Serde support

Sequences and most config structs now have serialization/deserialization support
via the `serde_support` feature.

## Improved error handling

The capacity limits specified in `AudioManagerSettings` are now enforced, and
the audio manager will also check that when you remove something with an ID,
something with that ID actually exists. Because this creates a lot of new error
variants, the large `AudioError` enum has been split up into smaller,
situational error enums.

# v0.3.0 - December 26th, 2020

## Per-sequence custom event types

Previously, custom events emitted by sequences were retrieved by calling
`AudioManager::pop_event`, which meant that the audio manager had a generic type
parameter for custom events, and every sequence had to emit custom events of the
same type.

Now, each sequence has its own custom event type, and you receive those events
from an `EventReceiver` that the audio manager returns when you call
`AudioManager::add_sequence`. This gives you more flexibility in how you
organize your custom events as well as moving some functionality out of the
`AudioManager` struct, which already has a lot of methods.

## Audio streams

Audio streams provide a way of sending arbitrary audio data to the mixer.
Sometimes, you need to play audio that you generate in real time, like voice
chats. This feature lets you do that.

## Groups

Sounds, arrangements, and sequences can now be grouped so that they can all be
paused, resumed, or stopped at once. This is useful for controlling broad
categories of sounds, like gameplay sounds or music.

## Other changes

- Added `Sequence::play_random`
- Added `Value::Random`
- Renamed `Sound::new` to `Sound::from_frames`
- Audio file format decoding is now gated behind feature flags
- Changed functions for pausing, resuming, and stopping instances to take
  settings structs (`PauseInstanceSettings`, `ResumeInstanceSettings`, and
  `StopInstanceSettings`)
- When resuming an instance, you can now choose to have it seek backward to the
  time when it was paused. This is useful if you need to keep audio synced up
  with something in-game, but you still want a smooth fade out when pausing the
  game.
- Renamed `Sequence::emit_custom_event` to `Sequence::emit`
- Added `AudioManager::seek_instance` and `AudioManager::seek_instance_to` for
  changing the playback positions of running instances
- Refined the behavior of looping backwards instances
- Added `Tween::linear`
- Make `Arrangement::settings` private and add settings parameters to
  `Arrangement::new_loop` and `Arrangement::new_loop_with_intro`

# v0.2.0 - December 6th, 2020

## Arrangements

This release adds `Arrangement`s, which allow you to stitch together multiple
sounds into a larger sound that you can play instances of.

The main use case for this is setting up seamless loops, including looping songs
with intros. The previous release could create seamless loops, but only if the
sound didn't have an intro.

Functions that dealt with instances of sounds now deal with instances of sounds
_or_ arrangements. `InstanceSettings` has become `PlayableSettings` to
correspond to the new `Playable` enum.

Arrangements also help reduce some complexity from the code for instances and
make some more unusual behaviors, like playing instances backwards or rewinding
instances (not implemented yet, but planned), easier to reason about.

I'm sure there's other good uses for arrangements, too! But I think the most
common use case will be songs with intros.

## Other changes

- Remove `SoundMetadata` and move `semantic_duration` into `PlayableSettings`
- Rename `StereoSample` to `Frame`
- Added support for panning instances:
  - Added `Frame::panned`
  - Added a `panning` field and method to `InstanceSettings`
  - Added `AudioManager::set_instance_panning`
  - Added `Sequence::set_instance_panning`
- Added parameter mappings, which allow `Value`s to map to parameters with
  custom scaling and offsets. `Value::Parameter` now contains a `Mapping` as its
  second piece of data. `ParameterId`s can be converted into `Value::Parameter`s
  with the default 1:1 mapping.
- Changed `Tween` to a C-style struct with named fields:
  - `duration` - the duration of the tween
  - `easing` - the easing function to use (linear, power, etc.)
  - `ease_direction` - the easing direction (in, out, in-out)
- Added chainable methods to more settings structs
- Replaced `AudioManager::events` with `AudioManager::pop_event`
- Add `Sequence:pause/stop/resume_sequence`
- Replace `AudioError::SupportedStreamConfigsError` with
  `AudioError::DefaultStreamConfigError`
