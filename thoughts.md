## Things I don't like about Kira v0.5.x

### Sequences

- Since sequences have a method for every action they can script, they have a
  lot of methods. This has some downsides:
  - The number of methods can be overwhelming for new users reading the
    documentation
  - Sequences add a lot to the code size of Kira - sequence-related
    functionality takes up about 1k lines of code
- Sequences encourage you to use the audio thread to provide timing info for
  gameplay. I'm not sure whether this is a good practice or not.
- Sequences are really useful for AetherBeats, but they have a pretty niche
  purpose. While I do think many games could benefit from being able to queue up
  audio actions with precise timing, a full-blown scripting system is probably
  overkill for most games. There's a lot of API real estate devoted to something
  most games won't use. It may be better to provide a simpler, lower-level tool
  for queueing actions.

#### Possible alternatives

- Most functions could provide a `delay` setting that lets you choose to wait
  for a metronome interval or a `Duration` before the action is performed. You
  wouldn't be able to set up complex scripting within Kira itself, but you may
  be able to get away with queueing things up from your gameplay code a little
  bit before they need to happen.
- Sequences could be simplified to only fire "triggers" that other objects could
  receive and respond to. Sequences would still be a complex scripting tool, but
  the list of things that a sequence can trigger would be moved out of the
  sequence impl itself.

### Groups

- Groups are a blanket category for many disparate things (currently: sounds,
  arrangements, and sequences. They should apply to metronomes as well, I just
  forgot to implement that). All three of those things can be paused, resumed,
  and stopped, but if groups expand to cover more things, that may not hold
  true. For example, what would it mean to "stop" a parameter?
- You have to remember to manually add groups to all of the appropriate sounds
  and sequences.

#### Possible alternatives

- Nested `AudioManager`s/`Backend`s
  - Nested `Backend`s could be routed to a mixer track of the parent `Backend`
  - Nested `AudioManager`s would have the same API as the main one
  - You can remove a lot of resources at once
  - "Pausing" an `AudioManager` would just mean stopping everything that
    updates - no ambiguity
