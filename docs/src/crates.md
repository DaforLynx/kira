You will most likely want to use Kira with some of these other crates:

- [`kira-cpal`](https://crates.io/crates/kira-cpal) - backend for Windows, Mac,
  and Linux targets
- [`kira-loaders`](https://crates.io/crates/kira-loaders) - adds support for
  loading audio files
- [`kira-effects`](https://crates.io/crates/kira-effects) - provides some basic
  effects that can be added to mixer tracks
